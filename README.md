Wisdom has a unique chat system. It allows you to chat with players, AI, and directly with the game environment via "slash commands". There will also be custom user-created slash commands for agencies. (soon)

Below is an example of a terminal command that creates a new user account.


Make sure you add the "/" before every command you attempt, or it won't do anything.
Copy
/create specifies the action, user is the type of "thing" you're commanding, and the following text generally completes the action.
Be careful when choosing your username as only 1 username can be created per Google account. Changing your username once it is set is not currently possible.

Here is a list of all functioning commands currently on the terminal:
Copy
Account Management:

    /create user <name> - Create a new account

    /login <name> - Login to your account

    /logout - Logout from your account


    Agency Management:

    /create agency <name> - Create a new agency (an agency isn't joinable by default; use the /joinable command to allow it)
